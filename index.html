    <!-- Organize your game code as an object, except 
        for the key events to get the letter guessed. 
        This will be a challenge if you haven't coded 
        with JavaScript before, but we encourage anyone 
        already familiar with the language to try this out. -->

<!-- Save your whole game and its properties in an object. -->

<!-- Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call 
    them underneath your object declaration using event listeners. -->

    <!-- create objects (and functions) -->
